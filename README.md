# Week 07: Design Patterns

## Overview

This week we will be looking at a variety of software design
patterns. A design pattern is a solution to software design problems
you find again and again in real-world application
development. Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of
objects, data structures, and algorithms. A design pattern is not a
finished design, rather, it is a solution template that must be
translated into solving the specific problem at hand. Learning about
and understanding design patterns will make you a more effective
programmer and provide insight into flexible design and software
systems that are more extensible, easier to program, and debug.
